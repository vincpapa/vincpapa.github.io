Hi! I'm Vincenzo Paparella, a Ph.D. Student from Politecnico di Bari (Italy) under the supervision of Prof. Tommaso Di Noia.
Before challenging this rollercoaster journey, I received a Master's Degree in Computer Science Engineering from Politecnico di Bari in 2020.

My research interest is **Multi-Objective Optimization** in **Recommender Systems**. These systems aim to provide suggestions pursuing several -- often competing -- objectives beyond being relevant for the end user. The objectives I consider vary from multi-stakeholder interests to the multiple facets of user recommendations and their trustworthiness.

These days, I am fascinated by applying Multi-Objective Optimization in _Graph-based recommendation models_. Indeed, the RecSys community mainly focuses on exploiting the powerful representation of users and items interactions through graphs to improve the accuracy of these systems. I aim to investigate how these effective models can enhance the other recommendation objectives.
